# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please use GitHub Security Advisories so the report can be handled privately:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Security" tab.
3. Use "Report a vulnerability" to open a private advisory.

If you cannot use the advisory flow, open a new issue with a minimal description and we will follow up.

## Supported versions

This project does not publish versioned releases yet. Security fixes will be applied to the default branch.
